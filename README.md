This repository collects code and data needed to replicate the results reported in the paper ["Modeling and Calibration of Pressure-Sensing Insoles via a New Plenum-Based Chamber"](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/9/4501). In our work, we presented a novel hardware developed for accurate calibration of pressure sensing insoles, as well as the optimization-based calibration method employed for identifying the parameters of the optimal polynomial models for each of the sensing units on the insole.
