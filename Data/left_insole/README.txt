The datasets reported here are for a left insole. The dielectric material used here is the Infinergy from BASF. The best datasets are:
- calibration_dataset
- validation_dataset_1
- validation_dataset_2
- validation_dataset_3
and they are the ones considered in the paper. We release the others as well to allow for further testing and improving of our method.
